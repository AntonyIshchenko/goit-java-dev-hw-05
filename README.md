# Homework Assignment

1. Develop three different implementations for solving the Fibonacci numbers problem: iterative, recursive, and dynamic programming approaches.  
2. For each of these methods, determine the space and time complexity.  
3. Prepare an appropriate type of UML diagram for each method.  

## Recommendations for Completion

When studying the topic of algorithms, focus on understanding how to determine complexity instead of memorizing it.

### Problem Description

The Fibonacci numbers problem can be formulated as follows:

Given a natural number `n`, you need to find the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The task is to implement an algorithm that calculates the `n`-th Fibonacci number and returns it as the result.

**Note:**  
The Fibonacci numbers are formed in the following sequence, where the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers in the sequence.  
That is, the first few Fibonacci numbers are:  
`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...`

The task is to find the `n`-th number in this sequence. For example, if `n = 6`, you need to find the sixth Fibonacci number, which is `8`.
